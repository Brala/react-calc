# React.js Calculator app

Basic react calculator with scalable display and keyboard support
Also added redundant redux demonstration

### things yet to improve:

- Write result calculation by hand (without eval() or Function() support) / eval() errors handling, "-e" issues, etc.
- Modularize handleClick function
- Add SCSS and TDD
